# Welcome

## el's techwriting portfolio

Hello! Thanks for checking out samples of my work in technical writing. A lot of my enterprise work has unfortunately involved a lot of closed doors in the form of NDAs and security need-to-knows, but I'd be more than happy to give you an idea of what to expect out of my writing style.

A few of the categories for documentation I have commonly worked on include:

### API documentation

Through 11+ years as an engineer in the Software space, I've also had to create documentation for API frameworks geared towards internal and external consumers.

#### Approach

_Who is the user?_ I like to take a user-first perspective to try and best capture the needs of the documentation.

e.g. internal users may have different security/authentication needs than external users that are trying to use the API for something completely different.

### Knowledge Transfer Documents

How do you communicate concepts/topics? When trying to communicate concepts to other people, I try to keep a few focus points in mind while writing the docs:
- What is the goal of the article? e.g. what do you want the reader to take away after reading the documentation?
- Who is the reader? e.g. is this someone with technical expertise or someone who is in a completely different field like sales?

This helps me stay focused on the **intent** and ideally providing value to the reader.

### Tutorial

**"Explain it like I'm 5"**, but for professionals. I have personally found tutorials to be the most helpful when there is a healthy balance from the author of _assume the audience knows nothing_ and _avoid overexplaining_. The end goal for tutorial documentation is for the user to be able to complete some kind of procedure and obtain some "know how" upon finishing.

I have found myself writing tutorial documentation for users internal to my own team/organization as well as users that are going to be using our products, whom I have minimal knowledge about.
